			<h3>How does this analyzer work?</h3>
			<p>
			   This analyzer creates a graph database while java compiles your project using neo4j. After this, it runs a set of user 
			   defined queries that search for common programming mispractices that are not detected by the java compiler.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>How do I create a query?</h3>
			<p>
			   The queries are written in cipher, which is the language that neo4j uses for its queries. 
			   The data model is not available yet, since it is not the final one.
			</p>
			<p>
			   This filed must be returned:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>column</li>
				<li>line</li>
				<li>file: it is in the enclusingCU "fileName" property.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is neccessary in order for it to work properly, for instance:</p>
			<span class="codeSegment">RETURN retExpr.lineNumber as line, retExpr.column as column , enclosingCU.fileName as file</span>
			<p>Also, this match must be included:</p> 
			<span class="codeSegment">MATCH (enclosingCU)&lt;-[:PACKAGE_HAS_COMPILATION_UNIT]-()&lt;-[:PROGRAM_DECLARES_PACKAGE]-(program) WHERE program.ID=$programID</span>
			<p>This way the query only searches one program, not all of them.</p>

			<h3>How do I fix an error?</h3>
			<p>The definition of the query should give enough info to fix the problem.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Why I can't name my query?</h3>
			<p>If you have problems adding a query because the name is not correct, this must be because you are not following the naming standarts.</p>
			<p>A query is named the same a java package is. For example "es.uniovi.myQuery" is valid, whereas "es.test-1" or "es..test" are not</p>
