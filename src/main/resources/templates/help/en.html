			<h3>How does this analyzer work?</h3>
			<p>
			   This analyzer creates a graph database while java compiles your project using neo4j. After this, it runs a set of user 
			   defined queries that search for common programming mispractices that are not detected by the java compiler.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>How do I create a query?</h3>
			<p>
			   The queries are written in cipher, which is the language that neo4j uses for its queries. 
			   The only condition is that the query returns this three fields: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Column</li>
				<li>Line</li>
				<li>File: the ECU (enclosing compilation unit)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is necesary for the report to be correct. Any query that does not meet this criteria will not work. Use this as an example:</p>
			<span>return retExpr.lineNumber as line, retExpr.column as column , enclosingCU.fileName as file</span>
		</section>

			<h3>How do I fix an error?</h3>
			<p>The definition of the query should give enough info to fix the problem.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Why I can't name my query?</h3>
			<p>If you have problems adding a query because the name is not correct, this must be because you are not following the naming standarts.</p>
			<p>A query is named the same a java package is, except underscores are not accepted. For example "es.uniovi.myQuery" is valid.</p>
